The explanation of this drawing is the use of color in 
all hues, saturation, and brightness to create a colorful paradise. 
I tried to use some of the elements of code such as commenting which helps other
people easily understand my code when they examine it. Another part of coding 
elements would be efficiency. I used efficiency her by using a differnt blend mode 
which allows the colors to change when in contact. This was an alternative to 
filling the seperate shapes with color to seem as if they are blending.
